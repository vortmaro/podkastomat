# Podcasts to listen to

If you're learning a language, and are at the point where you want to listen to authentic content, not necessarily aimed at language learners, you might find some interesting listening material here.

Podcasts which already offer transcripts to paid members (e.g. those of [Easy Languages](https://www.easy-languages.org/podcasts)) won't be listed. Please support them if you can.

Podcasts which offer free transcripts will be listed - please use their transcripts and don't waste power and CPU cycles generating new ones ðŸ™‚
