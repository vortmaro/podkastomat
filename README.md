# Podkastomat

ðŸª› A tool for automatically downloading and transcribing podcasts, with the option to translate them into English.

ðŸ“š Built for language learners.

Don't have any podcasts to listen to? [Try some of these](podcasts.md).

## Usage

To add a podcast:

```sh
./update-config add
```

This will ask you for the name, language code, and the RSS URL of the podcast, as well as whether you want the main process to automatically download the latest episode of this podcast when it runs.

To configure translating podcasts from a given language - in this example, German - into English (without this step, podcasts will be transcribed but not translated).

```sh
./update-config translate de
```

To process all configured podcasts

```sh
./process
```

To fetch and process the earliest 3 episodes of a particular podcast

```sh
./process 'some podcast' old 3
```

Online help for additional options is available via `./process --help`

Downloaded episodes, and generated transcripts and translations, will be stored in `podcasts/{language}/{podcast_name}`.
E.g.: `podcasts/de/mission_klima_-_lÃ¶sungen_fÃ¼r_die_krise`

## Manual configuration

Feel free to edit the `config.json` file

## System Requirements

* Linux (but it probably works on other platforms ðŸ¤·)
* Python 3 (tested on 3.8.10)
* One or both of the following:
  * [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper/) (supports transcripts and translations)
  * [Vosk](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/install#python-installation-from-pypi) (supports transcripts)
* [Mutagen](https://pypi.org/project/mutagen/)

## Notes

Whisper (used by default for transcriptions and translations) is quite slow and resource intensive.  
It may be worth running the `process` script overnight, e.g. as a cron job (see below).

To read the transcript using [Vortmaro](https://vortmaro.org/), you can start a local server in Python by running:

```sh
python3 -m http.server --directory podcasts
```

This will report what URL it is running on, e.g. `http://localhost:8000/`.

Open the URL in a web browser, and navigate to the HTML transcript of the relevant episode.

## Cron notes

When the `process` script finishes, it displays a popup message (using Zenity) about which
podcasts were transcribed.

To have this popup message work in a cron context, add the following at the top of your crontab
(`crontab -e`), replacing `MY_USER` with your username.
(If you're new to Linux, you can check this by running `whoami` or `pwd`, for example)

```crontab
DISPLAY=":0.0"
XAUTHORITY="/home/MY_USER/.Xauthority"
```

You can use something like the following entry to run the process at 1am each day

```crontab
0 1 * * * ~/git/podkastomat/process --whisper=~/.local/bin/whisper >> ~/git/podkastomat/podkastomat.log 2>&1
```
